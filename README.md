### ðŸ“¢ News

- ðŸŽ‰ **2024-11-27**: Accepted by **T-RO '24**!  

### Introduction

**Swarm-LIO2** is a fully decentralized, plug-and-play, computationally efficient, and bandwidth-efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry for aerial swarm systems.

Our package address following key issues for a ***UAV swarm system***:

1. Robust, real-time, accurate **ego-state estimation** and **mutual state estimation**.
2. High quality **global extrinsic calibration**.
3. Superior computation and communication efficiency which **supports large swarm scales**.
4. Excellent **robustness in various scenarios:** indoor, outdoor, dark night, degenerate corridors...
5. Support **diverse UAV swarm applications**: target tracking, collaborative exploration, payload transportation...

### Improvements

**Swarm-LIO2** improves our previous work Swarm-LIO (see below) mainly in five crucial aspects:

1) **Fast Initialization**: factor graph optimization is utilized for efficient identification and global extrinsic calibration, which largely decreases the complexity and energy consumption of the swarm initialization.
2) **Efficient Computation**: novel marginalization and degeneration evaluation are presented to alleviate computation burden and to support large swarm scales.
3) **Detailed Modeling**: detailed measurement modeling and temporal compensation of the mutual observation measurements are proposed, which mitigates the approximation error when fusing data.
4) **Comprehensive Experiments**: more extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments are conducted, which demonstrate superior performances in terms of robustness, efficiency, and wide supportability to diverse aerial swarm applications.
5) **Open Source**: all the system designs will be open-sourced to contribute the robotic society.

## Previous Work: Swarm-LIO

Swarm-LIO is a fully decentralized state estimation method for aerial swarm systems, in which each drone performs precise ego-state estimation, exchanges ego-state and mutual observation information by wireless communication, and estimates relative state with respect to (w.r.t.) the rest of UAVs, all in real-time and only based on LiDAR-inertial measurements.
